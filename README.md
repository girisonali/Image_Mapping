# Image_Mapping
This project demonstrates the creation of an image map using HTML and CSS. An image map is a graphic that contains clickable areas, known as hotspots, which navigate users to different destinations when clicked.
In this project, we've utilized HTML to define the structure of the image map and CSS for styling and positioning the hotspots over the image. Each hotspot corresponds to a specific area on the image and is configured to perform an action or navigate to a designated URL upon user interaction.
